Provides a header compatible with [android's NDK cpu-features.h](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/master/sources/android/cpufeatures/cpu-features.h).

It is intended to be a drop in replacement for this header and help users
transition from the NDK to [Google's cpu_features library](https://github.com/google/cpu_features).
